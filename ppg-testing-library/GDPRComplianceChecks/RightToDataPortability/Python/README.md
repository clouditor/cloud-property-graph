# Test Case: Article 20 - Right to Data Portability
- Test case description: The client sends personal data to the server. The server processes the data, saves it in a Mongo database. The client offers a function for the retrieval of his personal data in a machine-readable format. Also a function for the transfer of the personal data to another data controller is integrated in the client. The server performs these requests and transfers the personal data to the client or to another data controller in a machine-readable format.
- Expected outcome:
    - No data flow is detected which does not fulfill the code properties of GDPR article 20.
